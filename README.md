It was tested and verified on win10 x64 using compiler td-gcc 4.9.2 on code blocks IDE.

also library needed winmm.lib from microsoft corp. attach it from build project debendency libraries.

set relevent paths to all folders in micrium folder saved you from lot of trouble.

compile and here you go.

enjoy
